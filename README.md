Encrypting and decrypting app.

Based on a nearly uncrackable algorithm, this application lets You Â encrypt secret information with a code that only you and your friend poses. Only with this special code you can decrypt the information.

This app created as a self-studying project. It works but does not include exception handling like "no code" etc. It was not the priority at that time. The design is also quite "work-in-progress". :)
